2. Introduction
Objective:
"To develop an interactive simulator that visualizes CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling) with performance metrics like average waiting time and turnaround time."

Scope:

Simulates 4 scheduling algorithms.

Generates Gantt charts and comparative analysis.

Designed for OS students and educators.

3. Algorithms Implemented
A. First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
Principle: Processes execute in arrival order.

Pros: Simple, no starvation.

Cons: Poor performance for long processes.

B. Shortest Job First (SJF)
Principle: Executes the shortest job first.

Pros: Minimizes average waiting time.

Cons: Requires burst time prediction.

(Similarly describe Round Robin and Priority Scheduling)

4. System Design
A. Modules
Input Module:

Collects process details (Burst Time, Arrival Time, Priority).

Example input:

python
Copy
processes = [
    {"PID": 1, "Arrival": 0, "Burst": 5, "Priority": 3},
    {"PID": 2, "Arrival": 1, "Burst": 3, "Priority": 1}
]
Scheduling Module:

Implements all 4 algorithms.

Visualization Module:

Uses Matplotlib to plot Gantt charts.

B. Tools Used
Language: Python

Libraries: Tkinter (GUI), Matplotlib (Visualization)

5. Results & Analysis
A. Screenshots
Add 2-3 annotated screenshots of your simulator:
GUI Example (Replace with your actual screenshot)

B. Performance Comparison
Algorithm	Avg. Waiting Time	Avg. Turnaround Time
FCFS	12ms	20ms
SJF	8ms	15ms
Round Robin	10ms	18ms
(Include your actual simulation results)

6. Conclusion & Future Work
Conclusion:
"The simulator successfully demonstrates how different scheduling algorithms impact process execution. SJF showed the lowest waiting time, while FCFS was the simplest to implement."

Future Enhancements:

Add preemptive algorithms (SRTF).

Integrate a comparison mode for all algorithms.

Sample Conclusion:

"The simulator can be extended with multilevel queue scheduling for advanced scenarios."
