Gantt Charts for Each Algorithm
Include one Gantt chart per algorithm with these elements:

A. FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve)
Chart:
FCFS Gantt Chart (Example)

Data Table:

Process	Arrival Time	Burst Time	Start Time	End Time
P1	0	5	0	5
P2	1	3	5	8
P3	2	4	8	12
B. SJF (Shortest Job First)
Chart:
SJF Gantt Chart (Example)

Data Table:

Process	Burst Time	Start Time	End Time
P2	3	0	3
P3	4	3	7
P1	5	7	12
(Repeat for Round Robin and Priority Scheduling)

3. Comparative Analysis
Summary Table:

Algorithm	Avg. Waiting Time	Avg. Turnaround Time
FCFS	5.33 ms	8.33 ms
SJF	3.33 ms	6.33 ms
Round Robin	4.0 ms	7.0 ms
4. Key Observations
FCFS: Simple but causes convoy effect (long processes delay short ones).

SJF: Minimizes waiting time but requires burst time knowledge.

Round Robin: Fair but high overhead due to context switching.
